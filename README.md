## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got a better understanding on how the box model works. This is also the first time I used the grid system on my own. Dont think it was to hard and cant wait to use it again in future projects!

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get more practice using CSS, Im starting to understand it more but there is so much to learn. After that I want to learn more about JavaScript.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helps me everytime I need to understand how an element works.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Google is the best tool I use, if I get stuck I just Google it. which usually takes me to MDN.
